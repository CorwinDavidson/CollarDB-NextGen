# CollarDB NextGen

## What is CollarDB NextGen?

CollarDB was a fork of OpenCollar from 3.6 when OpenCollar dropped support for a web interface and database to hold collar settings.
  
CollarDB NextGen is my personal project to work on re-building the collar scripts and features by re-writing all of the scripts. Part of this re-writing process is to use lslForge to help optimize code and synchronize shared functions used in multiple scripts
